# <p align="center">Module 11 Challenge: Data Collection/Web Scraping
## Data Analytics assignment to scrape, explore, and analyze Mars news and weather data from websites using Splinter and Beautiful Soup
### Overview
1. Information/data scraping
2. Data analysis
3. Data visualization
### Features
1. Use Python, SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize climate data housed in a SQLite database
2. Address assignment prompts using the above methods/tools
3. Design a Flask API to create both static and dynamic routes to return JSONified versions of assigned dictionaries/datasets/lists
### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with and use of the Python programming language, and software to interact with .ipynb files, such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- Familiarity with and use of [Splinter](https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- Familiarity with and use of [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Familiarity with and use of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and its DevTools to identify useful HTML elements for the project
### Usage
- Download the .ipynb files to the same directory
- Within that directory, also create a new directory called "Output" (this will hold the files output by running each of the Jupyter notebooks)
- The output directory in the repository contains example output files for reference
#### part_1_mars_news.ipynb
- Launch Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the appropriate directory, and open part_1_mars_news.ipynb
- Inspect the dependencies and ensure they're installed
- Clear outputs (if desired), and inspect/run the code cell by cell, paying attention to assignment prompts and comments throughout
- Have fun exploring/playing around with the data/code! Challenge yourself to come up with ways to make the code more clear or efficient!
- Don't forget to close the automated browser by running the final line of code in the notebook
#### part_2_mars_weather.ipynb
- If closed, re-launch Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the appropriate directory, and open part_2_mars_news.ipynb
- Inspect the dependencies and ensure they're installed
- Clear outputs (if desired), and inspect/run the code cell by cell, paying attention to assignment prompts/questions/answers and comments throughout
- Have fun exploring/playing around with the data/code! Challenge yourself to come up with ways to make the code more clear or efficient!
    - Would you go about answering the assignment questions in a different way?
    - What other insights can we draw from the data?
- Don't forget to close the automated browser by running the final line of code in the notebook
